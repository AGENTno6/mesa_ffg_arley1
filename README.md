# Welcome Arley! ðŸ˜ƒ
------------------
This is where you can come and find notes and feedback to your assignments. The feedback you find here will be helpful for you to attempt your exercises as many times as you'd like or even for reference to notes.

You each have your own folders and files holding my feedback to your submissions. You have the ability to fork and clone these files into your VS Code so that they can live on your computer. **I encourage you doing this, let me know if you need any assistance.**

I've sent you an invitation to the repository which you should see in your email. Once you accept the invitation and have access, you should clone this into your VS Code environment by doing the following:

Click the Code button.

Make sure you hit the Local tab.

Click the SSH tab to get the SSH key, then use the copy button to the right to copy it.

First, always find and make sure you are in a suitable location to store and do this work in your environment. [You may need to create one using the make directory command `mkdir [name of directory]`.]

You may also need to change directories with the `cd ..` command. This takes you one level up.

Whereas, `cd ../..` will take you two levels up, and so on andÂ soÂ forth.

When you want to go into your folders you specify the route by using something like this:

`cd mesa_ffg_feedback_arley/mesa_ffg_arley1/assignment1`

In your VS Code terminal, type `git clone` then paste the SSH key you copied from GitHub. Then hit enter. Your terminal should tell you that it's 100% complete, if not go carefully through the steps and reach out if you can'tÂ find a solution.

Once the repo is cloned into your environment, you should make your updates to the code and remember to use ACP to update the repository as you work. In your terminal you write -->

`git add`, `git commit -m"____"`, git push -> hit [enter].

When you are finished all comments should be removed and you should save your work as you go as well with <br> Windows: `ctrlÂ + s` and Mac: `commandÂ + s`.

<br> ^^ This is how you add a comment in HTML. 
**Ive added all of my feedback to you within a comment. I also placed  my feedback as close as possible to the element in which I'm referring to.**

**If you need anything, you can always reach out via email!ðŸ“§**
